            "The giants of the design world, rare creatures capable of the new and the extraordinary, 
            all and each one of them masters of creation, inspired these pages. 
            Each fanzine is a unique view to honour and celebrate their work and legacy 
            as well as an experimental piece of creation itself."

            The Monsters project was born during Global Design professional intensive weeks, 
            where, over two immersive weeks, we engaged in a real-world project. 
            This experience allowed us to develop and enhance our communication skills 
            while deepening our understanding of what it means to work with a client—creating 
            within guidelines, listening attentively, and aligning with clients' goals and visions.

            In this project, we explore the work of Saul Bass, a true pioneer in the world of design. 
            His creations span various realms, including film title design, movie posters, and print advertising, 
            showcasing a diverse range of styles and a unique compositional approach that sets him apart. 
            To create our fanzine using silkscreen printing, we began by organizing digital layers based on 
            two primary colors—yellow and blue—carefully choosing their hierarchy. 
            Beyond the technical choices, these colors align perfectly with the specific chromatic combinations 
            frequently found in Bass's works, helping us connect more deeply with the designer being honored.

            The visual composition we created represents an ideal fusion of illustrative language and thoughtful sentences.
            We focused on highlighting Bass's personality, ensuring a smooth transition to the visual graphic elements 
            that we meticulously selected for implementation. This project not only allowed me to immerse myself 
            in Bass's artistic vision but also provided valuable insights into the transition from digital design to silkscreen printing. 
            I learned how crucial color combinations are and how essential it is to organize layers throughout the printing process.
            <br>
            Through this experience, I gained a deeper appreciation for the intricate nature of design and 
            the detailed process behind every element in a silkscreen print.
